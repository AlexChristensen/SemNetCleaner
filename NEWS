Changes in version 1.1.3

o fixed fatal bug in `correct.changes`


Changes in version 1.1.2

o updates to documentation

o fixed obnoxious message bug in `textcleaner` function

o changed progress bar in `spell.check.dictionary` to display words done out of words in total (rather than percentage)

o updated citation (PsyArXiv)

o added vignettes for preprocessing and estimating semantic networks


Changes in version 1.1.1

o `equate` now handles any number of groups (`equate.multi` is defunct and merged into `equate`)

o added a group variable for the dataset 'open.animals'

o removed option to save appendix dictionary to package (not allowed by CRAN policies)

o added a general function to read in common types of data file extensions: `read.data`

o updated `textcleaner` to bypass double query for adding a dictionary

o bug fixes in `textcleaner` and `spell.check.dictionary`

o updated `singularize` and `pluralize` rule sets

o removed `autoConverge` and `autoDestr` functions

Changes in version 1.1.0

o cleaned up examples and removed unnecessary datasets ('convmat', 'rmat', and 'trial')

o updated `spell.check.dictionary` to automate continuous string selection when continuous response length is greater than maximum continuous string length in dictionary

o changed output to have quotes around words being asked to add into dictionary to decipher whether they are a string or separate words

o updated `splitstr.check` so responses are not repeated after they've been corrected. Also no longer asks to split responses that are in the dictionary (splits them automatically)

o updated `word.check.wrapper` so that 10 responses are always given if the original response is not auto-corrected

o added additional nested list called `auto` to spellcheck object in `textcleaner` and `corr.chn` functions, which includes only the incorrect responses changed during the spell-check

o fixed save dictionary bug in `spell.check.dictionary`

o added a response option called, 'CONTEXT' to the `word.check.wrapper` function to give greater context around a participant's response

o added third auto-correct function using `hunspell_suggest` function to the `word.check.wrapper` function

o updated functionality of code -- improved speed of several lines in `textcleaner` and `spell.check.dictionary`

o fixed multi-word bug in `spell.check.dictionary`


Changes in version 1.0.0

o fixed bug in `rm.lead.space` for Linux

o updated `textcleaner` to default to `general.dictionary` when no dictionary is specified

o updated citation

o algorithm for `best.guess` was changed to Damerau-Levenshtein distance

o `corr.chn` function code was cleaned up and streamlined

o 'animals.database' has been moved to the 'SemNetDictionaries' package. It was renamed as 'animals.dictionary'

o 'animals.misnomer' was removed

o `textcleaner` function code was cleaned up and streamlined. Integrated functionality with the 'SemNetDicationaries' package

o `autoConverge` function code was cleaned up and streamlined


Changes in version 0.9.9

o animals.database: a database for animals was added

o animals.misnomer: common misnomers for animals was added

o textcleaner: added database functionality, which makes the cleaning process more accurate, efficient, and reproducible

o several wrapper functions added to aid textcleaning from a database


Changes in version 0.1.2

o autoConverge: significantly improved interface

o separated all function files into individual files

o semnetcleaner (changed to textcleaner): added argument to input participants by row or column; ids now included for output; added output to show what spellcheck changed

o destr: improved functionality to allow selection of separating character

o randwalk: added a function to simulate random walks on the network to examine spontaenous spreading activation

o bin2resp: a function to change cleaned binary response data back into character data for each participant


Changes in version 0.1.1

o cosine: added cosine similarity

o semnetboot: changed name to partboot and added the cosine similarity

o semnetmeas: moved from NetworkToolbox

o plot.partboot: a function that generates "raindrop" plots for bootstrapped data

o fine-tuned most functions

o semnetboot: moved from package NetworkToolbox
