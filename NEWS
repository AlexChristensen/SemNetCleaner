Changes in version 1.1.1

o 'equate' now handles any number of groups ('equate.multi' is defunct and merged into 'equate')

o added a group variable for the dataset 'open.animals'

Changes in version 1.1.0

o cleaned up examples and removed unnecessary datasets ('convmat', 'rmat', and 'trial')

o changed output to have quotes around words being asked to add into dictionary to decipher whether they are a string or separate words

o updated 'splitstr.check' so responses are not repeated after they've been corrected. Also no longer asks to split responses that are in the dictionary (splits them automatically)

o updated 'word.check.wrapper' so that 10 responses are always given if the original response is not auto-corrected

o added additional nested list called 'auto' to spellcheck object in 'textcleaner' and 'corr.chn' functions, which includes only the incorrect responses changed during the spell-check

o fixed save dictionary bug in 'spell.check.dictionary'

o added a response option called, 'CONTEXT' to the 'word.check.wrapper' function to give greater context around a participant's response

o added third auto-correct function using 'hunspell_suggest' function to the 'word.check.wrapper' function

o updated functionality of code -- improved speed of several lines in 'textcleaner' and 'spell.check.dictionary'

o fixed multi-word bug in 'spell.check.dictionary'


Changes in version 1.0.0

o fixed bug in 'rm.lead.space' for Linux

o updated 'textcleaner' to default to 'general.dictionary' when no dictionary is specified

o updated citation

o algorithm for 'best.guess' was changed to Damerau-Levenshtein distance

o 'corr.chn' function code was cleaned up and streamlined

o 'animals.database' has been moved to the 'SemNetDictionaries' package. It was renamed as 'animals.dictionary'

o 'animals.misnomer' was removed

o 'textcleaner' function code was cleaned up and streamlined. Integrated functionality with the 'SemNetDicationaries' package

o 'autoConverge' function code was cleaned up and streamlined


Changes in version 0.9.9

o animals.database: a database for animals was added

o animals.misnomer: common misnomers for animals was added

o textcleaner: added database functionality, which makes the cleaning process more accurate, efficient, and reproducible

o several wrapper functions added to aid textcleaning from a database


Changes in version 0.1.2

o autoConverge: significantly improved interface

o separated all function files into individual files

o semnetcleaner (changed to textcleaner): added argument to input participants by row or column; ids now included for output; added output to show what spellcheck changed

o destr: improved functionality to allow selection of separating character

o randwalk: added a function to simulate random walks on the network to examine spontaenous spreading activation

o bin2resp: a function to change cleaned binary response data back into character data for each participant


Changes in version 0.1.1

o cosine: added cosine similarity

o semnetboot: changed name to partboot and added the cosine similarity

o semnetmeas: moved from NetworkToolbox

o plot.partboot: a function that generates "raindrop" plots for bootstrapped data

o org.plot: an organization function for plot.partboot (not for individual use)

o convert2cytoscape: added a function to convert a network matrix into a sparse matrix for Cytoscape visualization

o added new examples with corresponding data files


Changes in version 0.1.0

o autoConverge: created an automated converge function to eliminate the manual converge process

o autoDeStr: created an automated de-string function to eliminate most manual de-stringing

o fine-tuned most functions

o semnetboot: moved from package NetworkToolbox
