#' SemNetCleaner--package
#' @description This package is mainly a wrapper package for functions called in SemNetToolbox.
#' It implements several functions that automatize the cleaning, removal of plurals and
#' continuous strings, making the data binary, converging, and finalizing of linguistic
#' data for semantic network analysis. It also includes databases to make the cleaning process
#' more accurate, efficient, and reproducible.
