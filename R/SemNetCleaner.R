#' SemNetCleaner--package
#' @description Implements several functions that automatize the cleaning, removal of plurals and
#' continuous strings, making the data binary. Also converges and finalizes linguistic
#' data for semantic network analysis. Uses the \code{\link{SemNetDictionaries}} package to make
#' the cleaning process more accurate, efficient, and reproducible.
