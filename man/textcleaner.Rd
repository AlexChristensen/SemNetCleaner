\usage{
textcleaner(
  data = NULL,
  miss = 99,
  partBY = c("row", "col"),
  dictionary = NULL,
  continue = NULL,
  walkthrough = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Matrix or data frame.
A dataset of text data.
Participant IDs will be automatically identified if they are included.
If no IDs are provided, then their order in the corresponding
row (or column is used). A message will notify the user how IDs were assigned}

\item{miss}{Numeric or character.
Value for missing data.
Defaults to \code{99}}

\item{partBY}{Character.
Are participants by row or column?
Set to \code{"row"} for by row.
Set to \code{"col"} for by column}

\item{dictionary}{Character vector.
Can be a vector of a corpus or any text for comparison.
Dictionary to be used for more efficient text cleaning.
Defaults to \code{NULL}, which will use \code{\link[SemNetDictionaries]{general.dictionary}}

Use \code{dictionaries()} or \code{find.dictionaries()} for more options
(See \code{\link{SemNetDictionaries}} for more details)}

\item{continue}{List.
A result previously unfinished that still needs to be completed.
Allows you to continue to manually spell-check their data
after you've closed or errored out.
Defaults to \code{NULL}}

\item{walkthrough}{Boolean.
Whether a walkthrough should be provided (recommended for first time users).
Defaults to \code{NULL}, which will ask whether you would like a walkthrough.
Set to \code{TRUE} to do the walkthrough.
Set to \code{FALSE} to skip the walkthrough}
}
\value{
This function returns a list containing the following objects:

\item{binary}{A matrix of responses where each row represents a participant
and each column represents a unique response. A response that a participant has provided is a '\code{1}'
and a response that a participant has not provided is a '\code{0}'}

\item{responses}{A list containing two objects:

\itemize{

\item{clean}
{A response matrix that has been spell-checked and de-pluralized with duplicates removed.
This can be used as a final dataset for analyses (e.g., fluency of responses)}

\item{original}
{The original response matrix that has had white spaces before and
after words response. Also converts all upper-case letters to lower case}

}

}

\item{spellcheck}{A list containing three objects:

\itemize{

\item{\code{full}}
{All responses regardless of spell-checking changes}

\item{\code{auto}}
{Only the incorrect responses that were changed during spell-check}

}

}

\item{removed}{A list containing two objects: 

\itemize{

\item{\code{rows}}
{Identifies removed participants by their row (or column) location in the original data file}

\item{\code{ids}}
{Identifies removed participants by their ID (see argument \code{data})}

}

}

\item{partChanges}{A list where each participant is a list index with each
response that was been changed. Participants are identified by their ID (see argument \code{data}).
This can be used to replicate the cleaning process and to keep track of changes more generally.
Participants with \code{NA} did not have any changes from their original data
and participants with missing data are removed (see \code{removed$ids})}
}
\description{
An automated cleaning function for spell-checking, de-pluralizing,
removing duplicates, and binarizing text data
